<h1> Journal Entry #1 (9/19/23): </h1>
 
 <p> We logged into github.io. I think this is basically a website where you make your website. I also made a token (which will expire in 90 days) and that is basically something that holds our website. So we went to terminal and we got into our desktop and tried doing some things on terminal. I made my terminal look cool (like a hacker). I then logged into my github account on Terminal and connected it to my website. It's really cool how relatively easy it is to just make a website, and there it is. Now when I search up "anr10.github.io" my website comes up. Right now it's basically a bunch of animal gifs. I'm thinking about making it into a sort of funny pet store. 

 <h1> Journal Entry #2 (9/21/23): </h1>

 <p> When I put code on my terminal, everything I write and do will be published to the internet. I have to use terminal. To do this, I have to use:

 <ul>
 <li> cd ./desktop/anr10.github.io to get into that folder. </li>

 <li>
 I then have to do git add .</li>
 <li> to add a change  and git commit -m "whatever I did"</li>
 	<li>To publish, I then say git push.</li>
 </ul>

 	 </p>

 <h1> Journal Entry #3 (10/3/23): </h1>
 <p> Today I kind of changed the whole of my website. I originally wanted to do a pet store but then I decided to do an ocean morning to night theme. Basically whoever goes on my website will scroll. They will first see the morning and in the morning be able to access my about me from a surfer. They will then go down and see day time. In the day time they will see something else (beach ball or plane or something) that will lead them to the journal. Finally, they will scroll to the night time and see an animal or a plane that will lead them to my projects. I added a lot of text today and figured out how to do things by myself. <p>

 <h1> Journal Entry #3 (10/12/23): </h1>
 <p> Today we started using javascript. We've learned HTML and CSS which are adjectives and nouns, but now we're doing the verbs, which is Java. So we learned how to inspect and that based on what you put in the script, it shows in the console. For example, if you put mousemove, whenever you move your mouse, it shows everyth
 	ing about your mouse moving. It's crazy because social media probably uses all this information to direct personalized ads (for example, about where you're clicking). I feel like we're finally actually doing more in depth STUFF and it's so cool. <p>
