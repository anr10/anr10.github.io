<h1> Journal Entry #1 (9/19/23): </h1>
 
 <p> We logged into github.io. I think this is basically a website where you make your website. I also made a token (which will expire in 90 days) and that is basically something that holds our website. So we went to terminal and we got into our desktop and tried doing some things on terminal. I made my terminal look cool (like a hacker). I then logged into my github account on Terminal and connected it to my website. It's really cool how relatively easy it is to just make a website, and there it is. Now when I search up "anr10.github.io" my website comes up. Right now it's basically a bunch of animal gifs. I'm thinking about making it into a sort of funny pet store. 

 <h1> Journal Entry #2 (9/21/23): </h1>

 <p> When I put code on my terminal, everything I write and do will be published to the internet. I have to use terminal. To do this, I have to use:

 <ul>
 <li> cd ./desktop/anr10.github.io to get into that folder. </li>

 <li>
 I then have to do git add .</li>
 <li> to add a change  and git commit -m "whatever I did"</li>
 	<li>To publish, I then say git push.</li>
 </ul>

 <h1> Journal Entry #3 (10/3/23): </h1>
 <p> Today I kind of changed the whole of my website. I originally wanted to do a pet store but then I decided to do an ocean morning to night theme. Basically whoever goes on my website will scroll. They will first see the morning and in the morning be able to access my about me from a surfer. They will then go down and see day time. In the day time they will see something else (beach ball or plane or something) that will lead them to the journal. Finally, they will scroll to the night time and see an animal or a plane that will lead them to my projects. I added a lot of text today and figured out how to do things by myself. <p>

 <h1> Journal Entry #3 (10/12/23): </h1>
 <p> Today we started using javascript. We've learned HTML and CSS which are adjectives and nouns, but now we're doing the verbs, which is Java. So we learned how to inspect and that based on what you put in the script, it shows in the console. For example, if you put mousemove, whenever you move your mouse, it shows everyth
 	ing about your mouse moving. It's crazy because social media probably uses all this information to direct personalized ads (for example, about where you're clicking). I feel like we're finally actually doing more in depth STUFF and it's so cool. <p>

<h1> Journal Entry #4 (10/28/23): </h1>
 <p> So I'm writing this on the weekend. Cause it's homework. So I made a jumpscare!! I feel like it takes too long before the site not found and the clown but honestly I like it. I feel like now using javascript I feel like I'm able to make more that moves and changes in an animation. I'm excited to continue doing this because I finally feel like I could make something like a real professional website if I wanted to. <p>

 <h1> Journal Entry #5 (11/14/23): </h1>
 <p> I don't think I've been writing the amount of journal entries that I'm supposed to. Anyway, right now I'm confused on why my code isn't working. I've been using javascript and I've been using a function where the image changes when a variable goes up. However, the images are not changing. <p>


 <h1> Journal Entry #6 (11/18/23): </h1>
 <p> So my gratitude card is basically for my parents because their anniversary is coming up soon. I feel like I commited myself to something that I should not have commited myself to.... It's really annoying because I made this a very long thing which I am not done with yet. I still need a few more images as well as figure out a bug. Basically the javascript I'm using is making an image change every time you click it as well as making a circle grow bigger. I think the click function is really cool because it gives a bit of a cool interactivity to your code instead of just scrolling through something that you can't really do anything with. I feel like I kind of get the hand of javascript now :)<p>
