<h1> Journal Entry #1 (9/19/23): </h1>
 
 <p> We logged into github.io. I think this is basically a website where you make your website. I also made a token (which will expire in 90 days) and that is basically something that holds our website. So we went to terminal and we got into our desktop and tried doing some things on terminal. I made my terminal look cool (like a hacker). I then logged into my github account on Terminal and connected it to my website. It's really cool how relatively easy it is to just make a website, and there it is. Now when I search up "anr10.github.io" my website comes up. Right now it's basically a bunch of animal gifs. I'm thinking about making it into a sort of funny pet store. 

 <h1> Journal Entry #2 (9/21/23): </h1>

 <p> When I put code on my terminal, everything I write and do will be published to the internet. I have to use terminal. To do this, I have to use:

 <ul>
 <li> cd ./desktop/anr10.github.io to get into that folder. </li>

 <li>
 I then have to do git add .</li>
 <li> to add a change  and git commit -m "whatever I did"</li>
 	<li>To publish, I then say git push.</li>
 </ul>

 <h1> Journal Entry #3 (10/3/23): </h1>
 <p> Today I kind of changed the whole of my website. I originally wanted to do a pet store but then I decided to do an ocean morning to night theme. Basically whoever goes on my website will scroll. They will first see the morning and in the morning be able to access my about me from a surfer. They will then go down and see day time. In the day time they will see something else (beach ball or plane or something) that will lead them to the journal. Finally, they will scroll to the night time and see an animal or a plane that will lead them to my projects. I added a lot of text today and figured out how to do things by myself. <p>

 <h1> Journal Entry #3 (10/12/23): </h1>
 <p> Today we started using javascript. We've learned HTML and CSS which are adjectives and nouns, but now we're doing the verbs, which is Java. So we learned how to inspect and that based on what you put in the script, it shows in the console. For example, if you put mousemove, whenever you move your mouse, it shows everyth
 	ing about your mouse moving. It's crazy because social media probably uses all this information to direct personalized ads (for example, about where you're clicking). I feel like we're finally actually doing more in depth STUFF and it's so cool. <p>

<h1> Journal Entry #4 (10/28/23): </h1>
 <p> So I'm writing this on the weekend. Cause it's homework. So I made a jumpscare!! I feel like it takes too long before the site not found and the clown but honestly I like it. I feel like now using javascript I feel like I'm able to make more that moves and changes in an animation. I'm excited to continue doing this because I finally feel like I could make something like a real professional website if I wanted to. <p>

 <h1> Journal Entry #5 (11/14/23): </h1>
 <p> I don't think I've been writing the amount of journal entries that I'm supposed to. Anyway, right now I'm confused on why my code isn't working. I've been using javascript and I've been using a function where the image changes when a variable goes up. However, the images are not changing. <p>


 <h1> Journal Entry #6 (11/18/23): </h1>
 <p> So my gratitude card is basically for my parents because their anniversary is coming up soon. I feel like I commited myself to something that I should not have commited myself to.... It's really annoying because I made this a very long thing which I am not done with yet. I still need a few more images as well as figure out a bug. Basically the javascript I'm using is making an image change every time you click it as well as making a circle grow bigger. I think the click function is really cool because it gives a bit of a cool interactivity to your code instead of just scrolling through something that you can't really do anything with. I feel like I kind of get the hand of javascript now :)<p>

  <h1> Journal Entry #7 (11/30/23): </h1>
 <p> Alr so this is kind of a reminder to myself to make a journal entry discussing my questions that I answered using ChatGPT. It isn't working on my computer so....I guess I'll have to do it on my phone. Anyway, today I made something that makes 70,000 cats. 70,000 because that's the amount of cats that are born each day. According to the internet. And then you can click on them if you want to adopt them and it makes a "MEOW" sound and the cat becomes happy. So it's kind of cute. I kind of want to make something that looks like a real professional website but I don't know what it would be about.<p>

 <h1> Journal Entry #8 (12/1/23): </h1>

		<p> These were my questions I asked Chat GPT and the asnwers I got.

 <ul>
 <li> What is absolute vs. relative vs. fixed in a div? Why is it necessary? - Absolute is telling a div where the exact coordinates it needs to be. Relative is giving it directions in order to find that place based on where it is. Fixed means that the position of the div is always in the same place.
 </li>

 <li> What is a child in HTML? - A child is just like a smaller box inside of a big box (they're kind of like subsets of a big container). </li>
 <li> Do most advanced coders use javascript? - Usually except it depends on what exactly thtey're planning to make. </li>
 	<li>How do you embed videos in html? - Basically you have to use iframe in order to get the video. You also need to get the code for the video from a video sharing platform such as youtube.</li>
 
 <li> Are classes parts of a background in html? - They're more like tags in order to put a group of elements together. It can be used to style and also to move. </li>

 </ul>

<h1> Journal Entry #9 (12/15/23): </h1>
 <p> For my gratitude cards, I'm making them for my two best friends and then maybe my other friend. It's not too hard because they're similar so I can just copy and paste the code but change the images. I'm making something similar to the pizza codesketch. Basically I define all my divs and then make a function called makePart (I'm making their faces where you can basically make who they are). This function sets what should happen when the mouse clicks. Then there's a function called makeDiv that basically tells it to place the part on the face and move it 50 pixels to the right and 20 pixels from the top of the mouse. I think I get this code a lot more than I did before which is nice. I'm not sure exactly what a "for loop" is but I do want to learn more about that. I'll publish my holiday card on my website page, and I think that it will be cool.  <p>

 <h1> Journal Entry #10 (1/9/23): </h1>
 <p> For this project, I first created a list of people in my family (and cats). I then created a variable x that basically just picks a random number. Initially, this started by just creating decimals between 0 and 1, but then I multiplied it by 5. This made it between 0 and 5, and then used Math.round to round it to the closest whole number. I then logged the number and then logged the person associated with that number. Therefore, now it logs a different person each time when I click.  <p>
